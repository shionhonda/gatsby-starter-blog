In traditional classification problems, there is often no natural "order" among classes (e.g., {dog, cat, bird}). However, in cases like restaurant ratings (0-5) or clothing sizes (XS < S < M < L < XL), there exists a natural ordinal relationship among the classes. Tasks that handle such ordered relationships are called **ordinal regression**.

Ordinal regression has "order structure" between classes that we can use to improve learning, so there are dedicated loss functions different from those in standard classification or regression tasks. This article introduces three popular approaches to ordinal regression.

## Threshold-Based Approach

The simplest approach divides ordinal classes {0,1,2,...,Kâˆ’1} into multiple binary classification tasks based on thresholds. For example, for 3 classes (0,1,2), the tasks are:

- Task 1: Is it larger than 1?
- Task 2: Is it larger than 2?

At inference, the final class is determined as follows:

- If Task 1 outputs 0, the predicted class is 0.
- If Task 1 outputs 1 and Task 2 outputs 0, the predicted class is 1.
- If Task 1 and Task 2 both output 1, the predicted class is 2.

This approach is relatively simple and intuitive.

## Soft Label Loss

This approach assigns probabilities not only to the true class but also to neighboring classes based on a distance-based weighting. A "soft label" distribution is generated and used to minimize the cross-entropy loss with the model's predicted distribution.

For example, for classes {0,1,2} with the true class $r_t$, the soft label for each class $r_i$ is defined as:

$$
\phi(r_t, r_i) = |r_t - r_i|, \quad y_i = \frac{\exp(-\phi(r_t, r_i))}{\sum_{k} \exp(-\phi(r_t, r_k))}
$$

where $\phi$ is a distance metric (e.g., absolute error). The cross-entropy loss between the predicted distribution $\hat{p}$ and the soft label distribution $y$ is minimized:

$$
L = - \sum_i y_i \log \hat{p}_i
$$

This naturally introduces the property of penalizing predictions farther from the true class more heavily.

## Ordinal Logistic Loss (Cumulative Link Model)

This statistical approach, also known as **cumulative link models**, incorporates ordinal relationships by modeling the cumulative probability. In this approach, the network's output $z$ is treated as a one-dimensional continuous variable, and learnable thresholds $\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{K-2}$ are introduced. The cumulative probability is modeled as:

$$
P(y \leq k) = \sigma(\alpha_k - z)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. From these cumulative probabilities, the probability of each class is derived as follows:

$$
P(y=0) = \sigma(\alpha_0 - z) \\
P(y = k) = \sigma(\alpha_{k} - z) - \sigma(\alpha_{k-1} - z), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K-1 \\
P(y = K-1) = 1 - \sigma(\alpha_{K-2} - z).
$$

These probabilities are used to compute the likelihood, and the **ordinal logistic loss** is the negative log-likelihood:

$$
L = - \sum_i \log P(y = y_i)
$$

This approach is theoretically grounded but requires careful implementation to ensure the thresholds are monotonic.

## Implementation Example

Below is an implementation example using [the wine quality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset) and a two-layer neural network. First of all, let's prepare some common functions for loading data and training the model.

## Summary

In this post, we covered three approaches to ordinal regression:

- Threshold-based approach: Decomposes the problem into multiple binary classification tasks based on thresholds.
- Soft label loss: Creates soft labels by spreading probabilities around the true class and minimizes cross-entropy.
- Ordinal logistic loss: Uses a scalar output and multiple thresholds to model cumulative probabilities.

Each method leverages ordinal information in its unique way. Choosing the right approach depends on the dataset's characteristics, the number of classes, and the required model precision.
